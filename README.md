# url-context-tool-sample

Simple example demonstrating how to use the Google [url_context tool](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/url-context).

The URL context tool lets you provide additional context to [Gemini models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) in the form of URLs. By including URLs in your request, the model will access the content from those pages to inform and enhance its response.

The notebook, [url_context_tool_demo.ipynb](.notebooks/url_context_tool_demo.ipynb), is meant to run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
